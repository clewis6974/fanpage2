<h1>The Life of Frank Sinatra</h1>
<h2>Page by Camden Lewis</h2>
<h1>Biography</h1>
<p>Frank Sinatra, born in Hoboken New York, on December 12, 1915. Is who would eventually become the face of jazz music across the United States. As a young child in New York, his parents ran a tavern where he would sing for a little extra cash. He loved to listen to the radio and try to emulate his idol, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_Crosby">Bing Crosby</a></strong>. He continued to keep singing despite what his parents tried to get him to do. While they did recognize his talents, they tried to get Sinatra to follow a more "traditional" career. When he got to high school, Sinatra was expelled for general roudiness. This is what began his reputation as a bad-boy. Later on, Sinatra got arrested for adultery but was soon after let out. By 1935, he got his first big break as a lead singer with a local quartet named the Hoboken Four. After this, he started working at a roadhouse in New Jersey while only making $15 per week. The benefit to this was that the roadhouse was connected to the WNEW radio station in New York City and began performing with a group live during the Dance Parade Show. Then after this he split to be solo. He released his debut album "<em><strong>DayBreak</strong></em>" that featured <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Dorsey">Tommy Dorsey</a></strong> in October of 1940. This album is what boosted his career to become the king of jazz.</p>
